## Laravel

This was the first time I got to work with Laravel and blade.
I got to learn this as a project in my back-end class.

I learned to work with the basics of laravel, and got to see how efficient it is to work with Laravel.
And let's not forget Blade, I'm glad I learned it, I use Laravel for every project I can use it for, like my new portfolio.
